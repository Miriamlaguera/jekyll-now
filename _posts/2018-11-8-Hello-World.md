Who am i?
Hello there, my name is Miriam Hernandez, I’m 16 years old, and I am the oldest of four. 
<hr/>
Eunice and Joselyn. Currently I attend college while still being in high school. I attend Franklin D. Roosevelt High school.
I also attend this college program that the High School i attend at offers..I’m in the Collegiate Program, where it allows me to attend college classes
at the same times as high school. At this rate I will be graduating on the year of 2020 and i will be graduating with my associates degree.I honestly did not plan to be where I am today nor to be attending these classes. I used to live in Irving, where i spent most of my childhood.
<hr/>
Bowie Middle School was the middle school i use to attend to, and i also attended Lee Britain Elementary school.Through out the years of my childhood,
my mother wanted to buy a house really bad, at one point she started looking for houses near where we lived by, but unfortunately we didn’t have any
luck finding one. Eventually my mom found some houses in Oak Cliff, and well we found one we all liked, in a great neighbor hood. After finding the
house shes has been wanting, we ended up moving here. I had just finished middle school, so I would be joining a High school. After moving here to
Oak Cliff i ended up looking for the High schools near where I lived, and when i found out which school I was attending, I did some research. On my
first week at Roosevelt, they had mention a program where we can be taking College credit classes and we could end up graduating with an associates
degree. I honestly got really interested and I signed up because it sounded like a great opportunity. After entering the program,
I started to communicate alot more and also participate with a lot of people to really fun things.
<hr/>
What are you doing here?
I’m here to graduate on the year 2020 with my associates degree. I want to be successful and this program is giving me a huge opportunity at life.
Graduating with my associates degree is good for jobs applications.Through out the years I’ve been participating in many different things, which have
been fun because I get to do these things with my friends, and also the program benefits. It has not been easy but I won’t give up till i reach my
short-term goal. This program is helping me be someone in life.
Where will you be taking this experience?
The experience I’am receiving here well for sure be used to help me get a job or start a career. At the moment I’am working and attending High school
with College. Working is just giving me an advantage because i get to learn about the making of money and also the College takes that in consideration
of what I can do, what I like to do and what I can do. All these experiences will help me know what it is i want to be and help me pick out careers.
At the moment i am also looking into joining the Navy but i want to graduate first.
<hr/>
When will you be done?
Although for the moment I’am only talking about graduating, i hope to be done in 2020, but at the same time, i don’t know because eventually I will end up picking a career and I don’t know at the moment if I will be needing more years of college.I want to be in the Army, being some where in the medical business. I’am sure that i want to do something in the medical business. Other than that i honestly have no idea for anything else i would like to be doing for the rest of my life. Of course I want children and a family but, what we depend on? I want to be able to keep my family save and able to have food in the fridge no matter what. Family wise, i would love to go see movies with them, or go to the beach, visit family members, go places we haven’t gone before or try new things that challenge us to be better, anything, I want a great life for me and my family. Everything I want depend on me right now, what do I want to be? How do I plan on getting there? Who supports me? Everything that will define, or impact my future depend on everything I’am doing right now, at this moment.
<hr/>
What are my hobbies?
I hope to be a great person and honestly use all these things I’am learning and use to them to my benefit.I personally don’t have any hobbies. I listen to music, and watch tv like any other student, also i love playing volleyball. Since i was in middle school, I’ve been playing the sport, and still played in high school but i had to stop because i couldn’t get a ride home after moving here, and I do live about forty minutes away from home on foot. Since i stopped the sport i just play volleyball when ever I get the chance too.I also started working not to long ago, so now i work at a fast food store. I’ve been working there for about four months, and is nice it’s a bit stressful and also working while finishing high school and college at the same time, is a bit difficult but i will graduate with my class. I want to be able to work and finish school successfully. Working gives me an experience on how life will be for me when i work and I could definitely use my experience to my advantage because i have learned alot of things, which means with my experience i can work at any other place with around the same job qualifications. Working hasn’t become a problem yet, at the moment I do feel a bit rushed but I can push through it because i believe I can. I only have about 3 things i do, id I dont do one I do the other.
