A 16-year-old girl is dead and four other teenagers were injured in a rollover crash in the Oak Cliff neighborhood of southwestern Dallas.

The two-car accident occurred near the intersection of South Westmoreland Road and Illinois Avenue around 8:30 a.m. Police say a Ford sedan heading westbound clipped the back of a northbound Nissan SUV, causing it to spin out of control into the southbound lanes of Westmoreland and hit a metal pole.
